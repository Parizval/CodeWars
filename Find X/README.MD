# Find X 

## Description 

We have a function that takes in an integer n, and returns a number x.

Lets call this function findX(n)/find_x(n) (depending on your language):

    def find_x(n):
        x = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(2*n):
                x += j + i
        return x
        
The functions loops throught the number n and at every iteration, performs a nested loop on 2*n, at each iteration of this nested loop it increments x with the (nested loop index + parents loop index).

This works well when the numbers are reasonably small
    
    find_x(2) #=> 16
    find_x(3) #=> 63
    find_x(5) #=> 325
    
But may be slow for numbers > 103

So your task is to optimize the function findX/find_x, so it works well for large numbers.
